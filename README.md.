This is a code for Basic Student Information System First we need to install/use a C++ compiler, in my case I used codeblocks. You can also use onlinegdb or w3schools. Just copy or download this files and open on codeblocks. if you are using onlinegdb or w3schools, you can also copy this and paste it in your chosen compiler. Dont forget to check for any missing characters or your you may encounter any error. Happy coding!
